# rn6addons

## About

This is a collection of the build scripts used to build some ReadyNAS OS 6 add-ons.

## How to use

Basically all you need to do is clone this repo, change into the desired directoriy
and run

`./build.sh`

## Help! It fails!
 
There's a chance that you don't have some or a lot of the libraries needed for a 
successful build. If your build fails and complains about missing dependencies,
then

- check that you have the `rnx6-dev` repo in the list of your repositories. If you
  installed an add-on from WhoCares, chances are you already do.

- try to install the missing package using `apt get <packagename>`

If you're still stuck open an issue.
